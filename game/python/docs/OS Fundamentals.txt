• Operating System Concepts covers the functions of operating systems, computer-system architecture, structure, operations, and storage management. 
• An Operating System is a program that serves as an intermediary between a computer user and its hardware, with the primary goals of executing user programs, making problem-solving easier, making the computer system more convenient, and efficiently using the computer hardware. 
• The computer system consists of four components: hardware, which provides basic computing resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices; the operating system, which controls and coordinates hardware use among applications and users; application programs, which define how system resources are used to solve user computing problems; and users, including people, machines, and other computers. 
• The Operating System (OS) is a resource allocator that manages all resources, decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair use, and controls program execution to prevent errors and improve computer usage. 
• The computer startup process initializes all system aspects, loads the operating system kernel, and starts execution by loading the bootstrap program, typically stored in ROM or EPROM, during power-up or reboot. 
• Computer system organization involves CPUs and device controllers connecting through a common bus, allowing shared memory access, and concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles. 
• Computer-system operation involves concurrent execution of I/O devices and CPU, with each device controller handling a specific device type and local buffer. 
• The CPU moves data from main memory to local buffers, and I/O is from the device to the controller's buffer. Device controllers inform the CPU when they've finished their operation. 
• Computer storage is based on the basic unit of bits, which can contain one of two values: 0 and 1. Bits can represent various things such as numbers, letters, images, movies, sounds, documents, and programs. A byte is 8 bits and is the smallest convenient chunk of storage on most computers. 
• A word is a less common term, which is a given computer architecture's native unit of data. A word is made up of one or more bytes. Computer storage and most computer throughput are generally measured and manipulated in bytes and collections of bytes. A kilobyte (KB) is 1,024 bytes, a megabyte (MB) is 1,0242 bytes, a gigabyte (GB) is 1,0243 bytes, a terabyte (TB) is 1,0244 bytes, and a petabyte (PB) is 1,0245 bytes. Manufacturers often round off these numbers, stating that a megabyte is 1 million bytes and a gigabyte is 1 billion bytes. Networking measurements are given in bits, as networks move data a bit at a time. 
• Main memory is the primary storage media accessible by the CPU, typically volatile. Secondary storage is an extension of main memory providing nonvolatile capacity. Hard disks are rigid metal or glass platters covered with magnetic recording material, logically divided into tracks and sections. 
• The disk controller determines the interaction between the device and the computer. Solid-state disks are faster and nonvolatile. Various technologies are becoming more popular. The storage hierarchy organizes storage systems based on speed, cost, and volume. 
• Caching allows for faster data copying, with main memory acting as a cache for secondary storage. Each device controller has a device driver for I/O management. Caching is a crucial principle in computer systems, transferring information from slower to faster storage temporarily. The faster storage (cache) is checked first to determine if information is present. If it is, the data is used directly from the cache. If not, data is copied to the cache and used there. Cache management is an important design problem. 
• Traditional computing environments include stand-alone machines, portals for web access, network computers, and mobile computers that connect via wireless networks. Mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, offer additional features like GPS and gyroscope, allowing for new apps like augmented reality. They use IEEE 802.11 wireless or cellular data networks for connectivity, with Apple iOS and Google Android being the leaders. 
• Distributed computing involves a collection of separate, potentially heterogeneous systems networked together. Common communication paths include TCP/IP. Network Operating Systems provide features between systems across the network, allowing them to exchange messages. Illusion of a single system can occur in these environments. Client-Server computing has evolved from dumb terminals to smart PCs, with many systems now serving clients. 
• Compute-server systems provide clients with interfaces to request services like databases, while file-server systems allow clients to store and retrieve files. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing environments are distributed systems where all nodes are considered peers, acting as either clients or servers. Nodes must join the network, register their service with a central lookup service, or broadcast requests for service via discovery protocol. Examples include Napster and Gnutella, and Voice over IP (VoIP) platforms like Skype. 
• Virtualization is a growing industry that allows operating systems to run applications within other operating systems. It is used when the source CPU type differs from the target type, and is generally the slowest method. Virtualization also allows OSes to be natively compiled for the CPU, running guests. VMware is an example of a virtualization service. Cloud computing is a method of delivering computing, storage, and apps as a service across a network. It is a logical extension of virtualization and uses virtualization as the base for functionality. Amazon EC2 offers thousands of servers, millions of virtual machines, and petabytes of storage across the Internet. There are various types of cloud computing, including public, private, and hybrid. Software as a Service (SaaS) is an application available via the internet, while Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a software stack ready for application use via the internet. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides servers or storage over the internet for backup use.
